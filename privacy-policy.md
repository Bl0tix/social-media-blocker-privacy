# Privacy Policy for Social Media Blocker Extension

**Last Updated: March 7, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Social Media Blocker Extension ("we," "our," or "the Extension") collects, uses, and handles your information. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our users' data.

## Information We Collect

The Social Media Blocker Extension collects and stores only the minimal information necessary for its core functionality:

1. **Website Blocklist**: The URLs of websites you manually add to your block list
2. **Timer Settings**: The delay time (3, 5, 10, 15, or 30 seconds) you've selected for each blocked website
3. **Extension State**: Whether the extension is active or paused

## How Information is Stored

All information collected by the Extension is stored **locally** on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). This means:

- Your data remains on your device and is associated only with your browser
- Your data is not transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers
- Your data is not accessible to us or any other external parties
- Your data is not used for tracking, advertising, or analytics purposes

## Data Syncing

If you have enabled Chrome Sync in your browser settings and have included Extensions in your sync settings, your blocked website list and preferences may sync across your devices where you are signed into Chrome with the same account. This syncing is handled entirely by Google Chrome's built-in synchronization features and occurs through your Google account. We do not have access to this data during the sync process.

## Permissions Required

The Extension requires the following permissions to function:

- **storage**: To save your list of blocked websites and extension settings locally
- **tabs**: To check if you're visiting a blocked website
- **webNavigation**: To detect navigation to blocked websites and display the timer screen

These permissions are used solely for the core functionality of the Extension and not for collecting or transmitting any personal information.

## Third Party Access

The Social Media Blocker Extension does not:
- Share any data with third parties
- Use third-party analytics or tracking tools
- Include any advertising or marketing components
- Transmit any data outside of your local browser environment

## Data Retention and Deletion

Your data is stored in your browser until:
- You manually remove websites from your blocked list
- You uninstall the Extension from your browser
- You clear your browser's local storage or extension data

When you uninstall the Extension, all stored data is automatically removed from your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The date at the top of this Privacy Policy indicates when it was last updated.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
